This page lists information on the various translation platforms where I have accounts on.

Go back to the page earlier for links to view current status of translations.



## Crowdin
{: style="clear: none;"}

![crowdin <](https://img.mnh48.moe/tl/platform/crowdin-128.png "crowdin")

Crowdin is a cloud-based proprietary localization tool. They provide their tool for free for non-commercial open source projects and educational projects, but charge people if it's commercial product even if it is open source product. They do contribute back to open source products despite being proprietary themselves.

Crowdin does not provide a way to quickly display current translation percentage, the translation status percentage of projects translated on Crowdin that are displayed on the website were calculated by fetching data through their API.

## Transifex

![transifex <](https://img.mnh48.moe/tl/platform/transifex-128.png "transifex")

Transifex is a web-based proprietary translation platform. It used to be open-source up until 2013 when it was discontinued. They provide their tool for free for open source projects, and offer paid plans for proprietary projects.

Transifex does not provide a way to quickly display current translation percentage, the translation status percentage of projects translated on Transifex that are displayed on the website were calculated by fetching data through their API.

Profile overview: [https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/mnh48/](https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/mnh48/)

Due to Transifex not allowing its users to change username and recommend people to instead delete their account and recreate account with new username, I lost the access to my previous translations by doing so. I have now got back into previous translation teams, though previous translation data association were lost (the translations themselves were still there, associated with 'deleted user' instead of me).

Member of Transifex since 13 March 2018, old profile deleted on 19 August 2020 to recreate new profile with proper username on the same day.



## Weblate
{: style="clear: none;"}

![weblate <](https://img.mnh48.moe/tl/platform/weblate-128.png "weblate")


Weblate is a web-based open-source translation tool. They provide their tool in two major formats, cloud hosted and self hosted. Libre and open-source softwares and projects are able to use their cloud hosted format for free, while all other cloud hosted users need to pay to use it.

The self hosted format on other hand is always offered for free, but you need to set up your own hosting to run it. You can also pay to get basic or extended support for your self hosted tool, otherwise you're on your own.

### Hosted Weblate

Hosted Weblate is the cloud hosted format of Weblate. It is provided for free for all libre and open source softwares and projects, however they do not guarantee the performance of the free instance. Hosted Weblate also has a shared translation memory in that you can see your previous translations from different project if you encounter similar strings to be translated.
