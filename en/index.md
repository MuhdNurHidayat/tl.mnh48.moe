## General profile

For my general profile, please see [my carrd site](https://mnh48.carrd.co).


## General Translation Information

Malay in Latin script is officially known as "Rumi" and Malay in Arabic script is officially known as "Jawi" by the government of Malaysia. As such, I write them as "Rumi" and "Jawi" instead of "Latin" and "Arabic".

All the Malay translations that I did were neutral, native and avoid loanwords whenever possible. This will ensure it to be understandable across the whole Malay language users, including but not limited to:
- Malay language users where Malay is recognized as national language
  - ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ Malaysia
  - ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡³ Brunei
  - ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ Singapore
- Malay language users where Malay is recognized as state or cultural language
  - ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Indonesia (in Sumatra and Kalimantan)
  - ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ Thailand (in Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani, Songkhla, Bangkok, Hat Yai and Satun)
  - ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ Philippines (in Bangsamoro and Balabac)
- Malay language users where Malay is the de-facto language
  - ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¨ Cocos (Keeling) Islands (Australian external territory)
  - ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡½ Christmas Island (Australian external territory)
- Malay language users in association
  - ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)

## Crowdin

Profile overview: [https://crowdin.com/profile/mnh48](https://crowdin.com/profile/mnh48)

Member of Crowdin since 10 February 2015, 9:32 PM.

Crowdin does not provide a way to quickly display current translation percentage, the percentage displayed were calculated by fetching data through their API.


Current progress (Rumi Malay):
- FredBoat: ![Malay translation of FredBoat](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mnh48.moe%2Fimg%2Fstatus.php%3Fname%3DFredBoat-rumi)
- FolderMount: ![Malay translation of FolderMount](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mnh48.moe%2Fimg%2Fstatus.php%3Fname%3DFolderMount-rumi)


Requested:

- GitLab (Rumi Malay)


Retired:

- Discord (Rumi Malay) - Request sent on 6th January 2018, 05:00 AM to add Malay, which was replied the same day on 07:38 AM with "When we get enough requests to start a new language I'll let you know!". Malay was not added, and on January 2019, Discord has stopped community-based translation altogether, and moved on to paid translation on unknown company. Malay is still not available on the app as of 14 September 2020.


Planned: Jawi Malay variants



## Transifex

Profile overview: [https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/mnh48/](https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/mnh48/)

Transifex does not provide a way to quickly display current translation percentage, the percentage displayed were calculated by fetching data through their API.

UPDATE: Due to Transifex not allowing its users to change username and recommend people to instead delete their account and recreate account with new username, I lost the access to my previous translations, including the API access needed to display the percentage of progress. While waiting for the remaining projects to accept my request to rejoin them, I'm displaying the last known progress in place of actual progress.


Current progress:

- uMap (Rumi Malay): Last known at 60% <!--![Malay translation of uMap](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mnh48.moe%2Fimg%2Fstatus.php%3Fname%3DuMap-rumi)-->
- Xonotic (Rumi Malay): ![Malay translation of Xonotic](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mnh48.moe%2Fimg%2Fstatus.php%3Fname%3DXonotic-rumi)
- MenuLibre (Rumi Malay): ![Malay translation of MenuLibre](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mnh48.moe%2Fimg%2Fstatus.php%3Fname%3DMenuLibre-rumi)

Retired:

- Tatsumaki - a Discord bot (Rumi Malay): Last known at 100% <!--![Malay translation of Tatsumaki (rumi)](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mnh48.moe%2Fimg%2Fstatus.php%3Fname%3DTatsumaki-rumi)-->
- Tatsumaki - a Discord bot (Jawi Malay): Last known at 20% <!--![Malay translation of Tatsumaki (jawi)](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mnh48.moe%2Fimg%2Fstatus.php%3Fname%3DTatsumaki-jawi)-->

Tatsumaki team has retired their Transifex and they are in process of moving to Weblate. They no longer accept any join request on Transifex and as such I cannot rejoin the team. I will join over at Weblate once they are done with setting up on their side, as the set up is still not completed yet.


Planned: Jawi Malay variants for those that currently only has Rumi Malay translations.
