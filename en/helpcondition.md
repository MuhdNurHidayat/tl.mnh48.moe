This is a list of the conditions required if people wanted to help me translate Japanese media to Malay. If you are willing to follow these conditions, contact me for a screening of qualification and help me translate. Do note that everything are volunteer and you and me are not getting paid unless someone out there are willing to donate to us.

- You must be able to maintain the style and quality of the translations.
- You translate them correctly from Japanese to Malay:
  - Not purely re-translate from other fan translation, eg. from English or other languages.
  - Maintain the honorifics other than -san, for example, -chan, -tan, -kun.
  - Maintain the original context, don't add your own context.
  - Maintain the pronoun level, eg. use "saya" for 私 but "aku" for 僕.
  - Use Malay particles correctly when needed, eg. "-lah" for だ, よ, だよ; "-kah" for か; "kan" for ね; "-lah, kan?" for だよね.
  - Use the correct Malay affix, eg. use intransitive affix like "**ber**gema" for 響く but causative-active affix like "**memper**gema**kan**" for 響かせる and causative-passive affix like "**diper**gema**kan**" for 響かせてくれる.
- You abide with the "second Malay style" of romanization for title and transcriptions:
  - Romanization is based on what would be pronounced in the Malay phonology:
    - Spelling used is old Malay style, so use "chi" instead of "ci" for ち, "sha" instead of "sya" for しゃ, etc.
    - Particles are "wa" for は, "ga" for が, "e" for へ, "wo" for を, "ni" for に, all of these are based on what we typically hear what's being pronounced in Japanese based on Malay phonology (not English or Latin).
    - Always romanize つ as TSU and づ as DZU in all situation except character / person names where it will be evaluated on cases basis.
    - Special case given to HU (ふ/フ), romanize it as FU if it is actually a loanword even if it's still heard as HU from Malay phonology perspective.
  - Long vowels represented by the duplication of the vowel, eg. tooku for 遠く.
  - For gemination, duplicate the consonant, eg. itta for 言った.
  - For glottal stop, use apostrophe, eg. a' for あっ.
  - Use hyphen to replace the middle dot in certain words, eg. "kyanto - bai - mii - ravu" for キャント・バイ・ミー・ラヴ.
  - Do not mix English word in romanization unless original title actually had English word spelt out:
    - アンノウン・マザーグース → Announ - Mazaa Guusu
    - ヒバナ -Reloaded- → Hibana -Reloaded-
- All names are written as original Japanese counterpart, not English or western style:
  - For pure Japanese names, it means family name first, and then given name, eg. Hatsune Miku.
  - For mixed Japanese names, just maintain whatever order it is, include equivalent symbols in Malay if the Japanese name also have symbols.
  - For name with different way of spelling, include both, with the Malay version in square bracket, eg. Asahina Mafuyu [Asahina Mahuyu].
- Include reading marker in Malay for English words if the pronunciation is not obvious:
  - Use é for the "e sound" and use e for the "ə sound" because that's what all Malay dictionaries used to indicate the differences.
- Jawi is optional as I will write them myself afterwards, but if you do want to write Jawi as well, jawifize the Japanese words correctly when needed:
  - Do **not** confuse between normal hamzah (ء), three quarter high hamzah (ٴ), and hamzah above alif (أ).
  - Japanese is not Malay, so the special Malay rules will not apply, "baka" (馬鹿) will be باکا instead of the usual باک in Malay.
  - Japanese つ (TSU) is ث (not تس like in Malay) and Japanese づ (DZU) is ذ (not ز).
  - Japanese ふ (HU) is always ح including in names.
  - Use the Sukun mark to mark the additional vowel, use it with ya for the sound e and waw for the sound o, such that Japanese 取れたい (TORETAI) will be توْريْتاٴي.
  - Use the Maddah mark to mark elongated vowel, for example チーム (CHIIMU) will become چيٓمو.
  - Always treat Japanese standalone vowels as standalone, so 舞い上がれ become ماٴي اݢاريْ (ma.i.a.ga.re) and not ماي اݢاريْ (mai.a.ga.re).
  - Glottal stop and gemination will remain as is, so ايٴتا for 言った and اٴ for あっ.
  - Use zero-width non-joiner if the original Japanese text has middle dot, eg. キャント・バイ・ミー・ラヴ becomes کيانتوْ‌باٴي‌ميٓ‌راۏو.
