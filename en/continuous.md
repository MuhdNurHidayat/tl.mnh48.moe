## bluesabre

![bluesabre <](https://img.mnh48.moe/tl/bluesabre/bluesabre-128.png "bluesabre")

The website bluesabre.org is where you'll find the latest Xfce and Xubuntu development updates. The domain is also used to group various software projects from a dev that's known under the same name, bluesabre. Hence, I'm grouping all of translation works related to bluesabre's software releases the same way and put it all together over here.

Softwares released by bluesabre uses Transifex for translation management.

## FredBoat

![FredBoat <](https://img.mnh48.moe/tl/fredboat-128.png "FredBoat")

FredBoat is a free music bot for Discord, it enables Discord users to listen to music in voice channel at the same time. It is no longer open-source, the bot was known to be written in Kotlin and Java, and it was licensed under MIT. The source was closed down because it had made too much burden on the developers to support various users' needs when the source was available openly, and that the source had became too hard to maintain. However, their developers are building a new open-source lightweight bot called [Ukulele](https://github.com/freyacodes/ukulele?utm_source=tl.mnh48.moe&utm_medium=referral) that aims to replicate the functions available on FredBoat.

FredBoat uses Crowdin for translation management. The works for Rumi Malay translation for FredBoat has started on 10&nbsp;January&nbsp;2018 and has been completed after a few months, and has since been kept up to date on Crowdin side. Server admin can change the bot's language to Rumi Malay by sending `;;lang ms_MY` in their Discord server.

## Liberapay

![Liberapay <](https://img.mnh48.moe/tl/liberapay-128.png "Liberapay")

Liberapay is a non-profit organization's subscription payment platform. It started as a fork of another similar platform, Gratipay, which eventually shut down because of various reasons. Liberapay does not take any fee from the payment made through their website, instead they depend on donation like other projects on their website. Currently, Liberapay is used by many people to fund many open-source projects including [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/donating/?utm_source=tl.mnh48.moe&utm_medium=referral#donate-to-the-project), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/8290620?utm_source=tl.mnh48.moe&utm_medium=referral), [Matrix](https://matrix.org/?utm_source=tl.mnh48.moe&utm_medium=referral#legend12:~:text=Matrix-,If%20you%20share%20our%20vision%2C%20or%20are%20building%20on%20top%20of%20Matrix%2C%20please%20consider%20donating), and many others. I use Liberapay [myself](https://liberapay.com/mnh48/?utm_source=tl.mnh48.moe&utm_medium=referral). The payment processor behind Liberapay is currently PayPal and Stripe.

## Mastodon

![Mastodon <](https://img.mnh48.moe/tl/mastodon-128.png "Mastodon")

Mastodon is an open source decentralized federated social network by the people for the people. It has microblogging features similar to Twitter, but they were operated out of large number of independent instance, each with its own code of conduct, terms of service, privacy options, and moderation policies.

Mastodon originally used self-hosted instance of Weblate for translation management before moving it to Crowdin. The works for Rumi Malay translation for Mastodon has started on 29&nbsp;October&nbsp;2018 on Weblate before being put on hold. Someone else had been translating afterwards, and then the move to Crowdin happened. I have resumed translating in Crowdin but I'm also fixing inconsistencies in the translations so it will take some time.

## OpenStreetMap

![OpenStreetMap <](https://img.mnh48.moe/tl/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-128.png "OpenStreetMap")

OpenStreetMap is the project that creates and distributes free geographic data for the world. The project was started because most maps have legal or technical restrictions on their use, holding back people from using them in creative, productive, or unexpected ways.

Different projects under OpenStreetMap uses different translation management platform.
