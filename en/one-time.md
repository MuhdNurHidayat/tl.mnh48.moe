This page lists current translation status for all one-time translations other than those that had been moved to the "divisional" category. All of the translation status below are grouped by the platform where the translation is published, or by organization or working groups if there's no common platform, sorted alphabetically.

Go back to the page earlier for links to view current status for other types of translations.

## YouTube

![YouTube <](https://img.mnh48.moe/tl/youtube/youtube-128.png "YouTube")

YouTube is an online video platform. The list of translation here were mostly for subtitle and description translation from the time when YouTube accepts community contribution. I do not translate all videos from any particular channel, instead I only translate whatever I'm interested in and coincidentally had the time to do so. Some of the subtitle might not be available anymore, depending on what YouTube had decided for the specific video when they removed the community contribution feature.

Some of the source subtitle file I create and the converted subtitle file uploaded is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/mnh48/ytsub?utm_source=tl.mnh48.moe&utm_medium=referral). Some of the earlier subtitle were made in SBV or SRT format, while the later subtitle were made in ASS format and converted to YTT format using [YTSubConverter](https://github.com/arcusmaximus/YTSubConverter?utm_source=tl.mnh48.moe&utm_medium=referral). All subtitles made were in Rumi Malay, this is because YouTube did not support Jawi Malay at the time I created the subtitles, and still not supported as of 31 July 2021.
