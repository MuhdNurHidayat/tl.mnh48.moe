The javascript file is only used for pages written in Beringin
This is because I need horizontal scrolling for those pages
as Beringin is written vertically, not horizontally

scroll.js is taken from documentation of horizontal.js
it is the loader of the javascript file
should be under the same license as horizontal.js

Please see the license files in the same directory for the license text
